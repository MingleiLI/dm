Title: Introduction to Machine Learning

Status: draft


Subfield of AI

Sometimes it is extremely difficult or impossible to  write a program as a set of instructions

## Applications of machine learning
Search - google works based on ML algorithm
Computer vision and object recognition - like in robotic cars, or face recognition in photos
Spam filtering

It is in every field.
Autonomous robotics,

Analyzing data:
computational biology(understanding genes sequences or recognizing diseases) , web and startups and analyzing data for business, finance, medicine, engineering.

Applications you can't program by hand:
Autonomous helicopters(teaching it to fly),
handwriting recognition(for example routing letters),
natural language processing(siri, google now), Computer Vision(robotic cars)

Recommender systems. Amazon/Netflix

Computational neuroscience.

## What is machine learning?
Field that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

Arthur Samuel. Checkers playing programm that is better than he is at checkers.
It played with itself thousands/millions of times, learning which board positions are good and which are bad, and eventually learned to play checkers better than he himself.

Tom Mitchell:
A computer program is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some task T, and some perfomance measure P, if it's perfomance on T,as measured by P, improves with experience E.
(it is so dumb, obviously there's so much more clear and understandable way of writing this!!)
Explain on game of checkers.
He still keeps saying "experience E"! that means E does nothing to make it shorter, just adds to the confusion =)

Types of Machine Learning algorithms:
- Supervised learnin
- Unsupervised learning0
Other: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems
//pracical advice about applying learning algorithms
giving set of tools and teaching how to use it.

## Supervised Learning
### Regression
Example. Housing prices.
price/size in feet.
fit a straight line through the data. or a quadratic/polynomial functio
prive/size in feet - graph in matplotlib!!
(regression - fitting a line)

#### Classification
//clustering
Breast cancer malignant/benign.
Estimate probability of that.

Features/attributes.

Examples

## Unsupervised learning
Unlabeled data, without knowing what data means, find the patterns.
Find some structure in data.
CLustering.
Example - google news.

Group peoply by genes. find structure in genes.
social vetwork analysis
market segmentation
astronomical data analysis

coctail party problem.
