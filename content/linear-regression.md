## Linear Regression
### Model representation
housing prices - better example
[graph]

supervised learnong, regression.
[table] size vsprice

m - number of training examples
x - "input" variable - features
y - output"("target") variable
(x,y) - one raining example
(x^(i), y^(i)) - i'th training example. i'th row of the table.
